CREATED:

    tpl/bootstrap3/comp_addons/contribute_btn.php
    tpl/bootstrap3/comp_addons/whatsapp_share.php  --- have no idea how the css file is getting linked to this one.

    phpincludes/home.php
    phpincludes/content_filter.php

    tpl/bootstrap3/comp_addons/change_contr_forms_lang.php (unused)
    tpl/bootstrap3/comp_addons/get_lang_ns.php (unused)

    phpincludes/en_home.php (removed)
    phpincludes/hi_home.php (removed)
    phpincludes/global_home.php (removed)

    var_config.php : really shitty way to create a consolidated area for
    some key vars which i can keep changing, and the code remains intact.
    Though, honestly, i think the only place where i have used these is in phpincludes/content_filer.php
