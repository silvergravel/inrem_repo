 A good example of the safe water sharing from the private source among the villagers is seen in the village Thanagadia of the Remuna Block of the Balasore district. Through drinking water survey done by the DFMC it is observed that most of the source is contaminated with high fluoride due to which villagers are suffering from dental and skeletal fluorosis from a decade. After PRA performed by the DFMC team in the village to sensitize the villagers on the fluorosis issue. After detailed group discussion among the villagers, community understood the problem and solutions to mitigate the fluorosis issue. water quality result showed that there is 2 safe water source available in the village but those were the private source. Continuous triggering on the sharing of the safe water source, the owner Mr Vijay Das got motivated and agreed to share the water free of the cost. after the process Head man of the village Mr Kailash Das also agreed to share the water. This process is helping 60 Household of the Khandayat and Adiwasi Sahi to get safe drinking water free of cost and without any investment of external technology.
