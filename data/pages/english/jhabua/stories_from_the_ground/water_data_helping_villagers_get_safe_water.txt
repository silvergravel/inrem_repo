The team of Mr Sachin Vani from INREM and Mr Arman Kapoor, tested 44 water sources from Jhabua and Ali Rajpur districts. The data from this testing has been shared here (see this link http://bit.ly/akdec18data). 

These water sources include the Jobat block of Ali Rajpur district where fluoride in water is now being identified. This has been a new finding and few thousand people here are suffering from fluorosis.

This programme of fluoride testing has now led to more attention and proposed action on the problem of fluorosis in Ali Rajpur. One outcome of this effort is a proposal to the Education department, of MP, for taking action from college students on testing of fluoride and raising more awareness on the issue. More such initiatives are being planned
