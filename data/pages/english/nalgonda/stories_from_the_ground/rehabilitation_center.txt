== Summary ==

The story is about the unavailability of access to rehabilitative care for people who are suffering from Fluorosis.

It's about what can be done to create systems for better referrals for these people, whose problems right now are not addressed.

== Context ==
{{english:nalgonda:stories_from_the_ground:rehabilitation_center:image_49_.jpg?800X600}}

A field visit to most affected locations, having a look at the seriousness of the situation, with so many children not being able to move in their houses.

Lying all day on cots, wondering whats gonna happen with their lives, staring continuosly

The emotions of their mothers, unable to bear this pain

Us wanting to start something that can really help, and goes beyond just rhetoric.

== Initiatives ==

We built our thinking on what are those specific things we could do that could actually build that access for Fluorosis sufferers. Something that was not a one of initiative or a one of camp, but becomes a go to place for always which people can go to for their problems

We felt that this place needs to have all the components of rehabilitation, be it physical, nutritional or medical care. a complete solution for people.

We came up with an idea for a Fluorosis Rehabilitation Centre and felt it would be best for it to operate from with a PHC.

We interacted with the District Collector on this idea, and impressed upon the need for something like this to be there. We put forward a specific budget on whats needed to start this centre

We got some support from a local rehabilitation College to input with help setting things up



\\

== Impact ==
{{english:nalgonda:stories_from_the_ground:rehabilitation_center:img-20190205-wa0012.jpg?800X600}}

The District Collector seeing how significant this kind of an effort would be for lives that are affected sanctioned a budget for the Centre, he put forward instructions to the Water department to interact with the CMHO (Health) and get the room in the PHC sanctioned.

As I am writing today the Collector has had a meeting with CMHO and the PHC Incharge asking them to arrange for an X Ray Machine, an ambulance to carry cases to be referred to the Centre, an X Ray machine to be installed at the PHC and a dedicated radiographer for the Centre and for the PHC.

Above all this he has also gone ahead and said whatever more equipment needs to be purchased for the centre can be purchased and the Centre would go ahead and support it.

There's more..he is also going to have a review after a month to see how things he has said are being taken up for the centre




\\

== Current Situation ==
{{@@current_situation_image_upload_@@?800X600}}

The Centre has now been inaugurated and is getting ready to start with all the support that is coming in.

There will be a training for two rehabilitation volunteers who would be appointed in a week's time

And the Centre looks all set to be in a functional mode by end of this month.

We are happy to see what started with that one wish to try and make a difference in these people's lives is actually there now and moving ahead.
